# 🎉300 problems, 

I try to answer almost everyone,

To participate in both knowledge and friendship. 
That is my indirect way of helping.
I do not give money,but knowledge. 
It is something that helps fellow human beings.
I answer incorrectly, someone will come and correct me.
I will be very happy.
But please speak nicely to me,
do not use mocking words, 
because I did not graduate in computer science, 
my basics are not at university level,
and importantly, I respond quickly to insults. 

Thank so much ❤️❤️❤️💐
